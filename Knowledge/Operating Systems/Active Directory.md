A directory service for windows network environments. Provides centralised management of resources, users, devices etc. Covers authentication and authorisation features too.

It's essentially a read-only database that *any user* (regardless of privilege) can enumerate, meaning it can be searched for potentially exploitable misconfigurations. It is extremely important to properly secure an AD implementation (network segmentation, least privilege, hardening etc).
