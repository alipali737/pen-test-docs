## Network Segmentation
*Network Segmentation* is the basic practice of breaking larger networks into smaller, functionally similar networks with different access levels. This improves both security and performance.

When segmenting a network, we should consider:
- The role of each segment
- Which assets we are trying to protect
- Who can access which network

Home network example could include:
- Owner's VLAN
- Guest VLAN
- Smart IoT Devices VLAN

## Access Point Placement
Its important to consider both the *placement* and *strength* of our access points. The access point should also be hidden from view so it cannot be physically configured.

## Encryption
All wireless activity should be securely encrypted. Currently, the accepted standard for security is WPA2. WPA2-Personal will require a single password to access Wi-Fi, while WPA2-Enterprise will require multi-factor authentication.

It is recommended for home networks to setup a custom network with a name & password rather than relying on the default one provided by the router.
