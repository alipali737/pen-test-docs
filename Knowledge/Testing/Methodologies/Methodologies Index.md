# Penetration Testing Methodologies

## OWASP Testing Guides
OWASP maintains a series of technical guides for a range of penetration testing applications:
- [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)
- [Firmware Security Testing Methodology](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)

## Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
The OSSTMM is a methodology primarily for testing the security of physical aspect (locations, procedures, humans) and network infrastructure. OSSTMM is more of a supporting reference of ISO 27001 instead of a practical guide for penetration testing.

OSSTMM includes the following sections:
- Security Analysis
- Operational Security Metrics
- Trust Analysis
- Work Flow
- Human Security Testing
- Physical testing
- Wireless testing
- Telecomms testing
- Data networks testing
- Compliance regulations
- Reporting with the STAR (Security Test Audit Report)

## Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
[PTES Technical Guidelines](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines) gives hands-on suggestions on testing procedures and recommendations for security testing tools. They define 7 key phases:
- Pre-engagement interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modelling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

## PCI Penetration Testing Guide
The **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)** requirement 11.3 defines the appropriate penetration testing and guidance.

### PCI DSS Penetration Testing Guidance
The guidelines cover the following:
- Penetration Testing components
- Qualifications of a Pen Tester
- Penetration Testing Methodologies
- Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines

### PCI DSS Penetration Testing Requirements
The PCI DSS Requirement 11.3
- Covers Common Desktop Environments (CDEs) and critical systems
- Includes internal and external testing
- Guidance on PCI DSS scope reduction
- Application-layer testing
- Network-layer testing for network and OS

## Penetration Testing Framework (PTF)
The PTF provides a comprehensive hands-on guide for PT. It lists usages of the security testing tools for each testing category, including major areas:
- Network reconnaissance
- Discovery and Probing
- Enumeration
- Password cracking
- Bluetooth specific testing
- Cisco specific testing
- Citrix specific testing
- Network analysis
- Server specific tests
- VoIP Security
- Wireless Penetration
- Physical Security
- Final Report (template)
