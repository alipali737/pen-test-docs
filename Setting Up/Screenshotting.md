# Documenting via Screenshots
Screenshots serve as a momentary record and represent proof of results obtained, necessary for the Proof-Of-Concept and our documentation. One of the best tools for this is [Flameshot](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot). It has all the essential functions that we need to quickly edit our screenshots without using an additional editing program. We can install it using our APT package manager or via download from Github.

Sometimes, however, we cannot show all the necessary steps in one or more screenshots. We can use an application called [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) and create GIFs that record all the required actions for us.
