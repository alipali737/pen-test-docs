## Summary
*Internet Message Access Protocol* (*IMAP*) & *Post Office Protocol* (*POP3*) are protocols for accessing emails from a mail server. 

*IMAP* allows for online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. The client-server protocol allows synchronisation of local email clients with the mail server (like a network file share). This means that it does require an active connection to manage emails.

*POP3* only provides listing, retrieving, and deleting emails as functions at the email server. It downloads emails from the server onto the local client, removing them on the server (meaning they can't be accessed on another client).
