## How it works
- Supports TLS/SSL but many windows systems don't insist it must be used. 
- By default the certificates are self-signed.
- It comes installed on windows by default. Activated using the *Server Manager*.
- Defaults to only allowing connections from hosts with [Network level authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Level_Authentication)Â (*NLA*).
