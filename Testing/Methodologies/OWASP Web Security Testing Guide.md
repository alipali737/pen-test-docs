# Principles of Testing
[Section Link](https://arc.net/l/quote/iqeedvsr)
- **There is no silver bullet** : there is no one method to solve the problem of insecure software. Security is a process and not a product, taking lots of different approaches to ensuring security (scanners, protections, tests etc).
- **Think Strategically, not Tactically** : Just simply patching a vulnerability without proper root cause analysis with hinder the security of an application. Time and care should be taken to address the root cause of the insecurity and fix it at the source.
- **SDLC is King** : Security should be incorporated into the SDLC to ensure security is embedded through the entire development process.
- **Test Early and Test Often** : The earlier a bug is found, the easier, faster, and cheaper it is to fix.
- **Test Automation** : Test automation should be incorporated into the development pipeline to establish a baseline security analysis.
- **Understand the Scope of Security** : It is critical to understand how much security a project will require. Assets should be given a classification that states how they are to be handled (eg. confidential, secret, top secret). Additional security may be needed for personal data for instance.
- **Thinking outside the box** : Normal cases will test the application being used as it is expected. The job of a good security test is to test the unexpected. Tests should focus on thinking like an attacker trying to break the application. This will also highlight any incorrect assumptions made by developers.
- **Understand the Subject** : Understanding the technical documentation of a system is key to identifying weaknesses (use cases, data-flow, architecture etc).
- **Use the Right Tools** : Understanding what security tooling does exactly, and what it cannot do.
- **The Detail is Key** : False positives happen and can undermine the report's valid message. A test should take care to test every possible section of application logic and use case scenario for possible vulnerabilities.
- **Use Source Code when Available** : Black-box tests are useful for demonstrating how vulnerabilities can be exposed in a production system, however without visibility of the source code, some vulnerable paths may never be tested.
- **Develop Metrics** : Understanding the metrics for an applications security can reveal security trends within an organisation.
- **Document the Test Results** : A report should be suitable for all parties that may have concerns in the results (eg. stakeholders). It should highlight risks to the business owner, pin-pointing the fault for developers to address, as well as instructions for another tester to reproduce. Using a template is essential for a security tester to ensure the right information is provided without the report writing becoming burdensome.

# Web Application Testing
Throughout a test, it is important to gather all the destinations, URLs, access points, and understood knowledge of the system as the test is conducted.

## [1. Information Gathering](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/)
### Search Engine Discovery Reconnaissance
The purpose of this process is to utilise search engines to discover information leakage regarding a target. This could come directly from the target or in-directly from forums, blogs, social media etc.

**Test Objective:** Identify sensitive design and configuration information about the target directly or in-directly exposed.

**Test Intentions:** Aim is to discover sensitive information about the target eg.
- Network diagrams and configurations
- Archived content from key users (admins, employees)
- Authentication implementations or procedures and username formats
- Usernames, passwords, and private keys
- Error message content
- Non-production versions of the target

**Search Engines:**
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) : Most popular search engine globally
- [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) : Microsoft search engine
- [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/) : Chinaâ€™s most popular search engine
- [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) : Internet archives
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) : Privacy-focused search engine compiling many different sources

**Search Operators**
This syntax can be used to craft specific results from searches (also known as Dorking or Google Hacking) generally following the `<operator>:<query>` format. Some of the most useful are:
- `site:` will limit the search to the provided domain.
- `inurl:` will only return results that include the keyword in the URL.
- `intitle:` will only return results that have the keyword in the page title.
- `intext:` or `inbody:` will only search for the keyword in the body of pages.
- `filetype:` will match only a specific filetype, i.e. png, or php.
- `cached:` will show you previously indexed content (useful to see content that may have changed)

Databases such as [Google Hacking Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database), or [Google Hacking Diggity Project](https://resources.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/google-hacking-diggity/) (for sites Bing or Shodan) are available.

**Remediation:**
- Review the confidentiality and sensitivity of information relating to the target system before its posted online
- Periodically review the sensitivity of existing information online

---

### Web Server Fingerprinting
This process is to identify the type and version of web server that a target is running on using key indicators and recognisable traits. Many tools do this automatically now but the underlying process is useful to know.

**Test Objectives:** To identify the type and version of a running web server to further discover known vulnerabilities

**Banner Grabbing**
Often in HTTP responses from a web server, information about the system is sent in the header. This can give away server type and version information to an attacker. Tools like [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telnet), [Nmap](https://nmap.org/), and [NetCat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) can all do this. Tools like `openssl` can also do this for SSL connections.

Sometimes, servers may remove this information from the response header, however the server type could still be inferred by checking the order in which the information appears.

In an Apache response the data order is:
- Date
- Server
- Content-Type

but for an nginx site it is:
- Server
- Date
- Content-Type

This method is not for definite but can give indications.

**Malformed Requests**
Sending incorrect or malformed requests to a server could prompt it to return a default error response. This can give away the server type by analysing the returned result if it hasn't be customised.

**Automatic Scanning Tools**
These tools use large databases and more specific server probes to quickly identify information about a web server or service on a network. Some common tools are:
- [Netcraft](https://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report) : an online tool for scanning websites
- [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto) : an open-source CLI tool
- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) : an open-source CLI tool which also has a GUI version, [Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/)

**Remediation**
- Obscure web server information in headers
- Using a hardened reverse proxy server to add an additional layer of security between the web server and the internet
- Updating web server default messages
- Ensuring servers are kept up-to-date with patches

---

### Web Application Enumeration
Often a single IP address will host multiple web servers or services that should be enumerated for discovery. However, like with all enumeration, **it is critical to stay within scope**.

**The Three Factors**
There are three key factors that influence the number of applications for a given DNS name (or IP address):
- **Different Base URL** : A website could break norms and actually begin the address after the `/` following the base domain eg. `example.com/website1` & `example.com/website2`. These aren't 'secret' but just not explicitly advertised and could be differing applications.
  - **Approaches:**
    - If a web server is misconfigured and allows directory browsing it may be possible to identify these applications
    - Using search operators for the site may reveal URLs that could point to non-obvious applications that have been cached
    - Probing or using directory enumeration tools could identify common addresses
    - Vulnerability scanners can often help in approaching this

- **Non-standard Ports** : Web apps usually live on port 80 (http) or 443 (https), there is nothing stopping them being on non-standard ports. The same applies for other protocols.
  - **Approaches:**
    - Utilising a port scanner such as `nmap` can identify http[s] services running on arbitrary ports.
    - A full scan of the whole 64k TCP port address space is required to test all ports
    - Using something like `nmap -Pn -sT -sV -p0-65535 <IP Address>` (`-Pn` : treats all as online; `-sT` : attempt TCP Connect; `-sV` : probe to determine service info) would be sufficient to examine the output and identify any services that are HTTP or look like SSL (should be probed to confirm https using the browser, not all SSL services are HTTPS, some are just SSL-wrapped services).

- **Virtual Hosts** : An IP can be associated to one or more symbolic names via DNS. This means that aside from `example.com` a `webmail.example.com` or `helpdesk.example.com` could exist and utilise the `HOST` header to indicate the target application.
  - **Approaches:**
    - DNS Zone Transfers can potentially be used (although this is a bit out-dated now) to get all associated aliases for an IP address in a DNS (tools: `nslookup`,`host`,`dig`)
      - First look up the name servers for an address `host -t ns <target url>`
      - Then you can request a DNS zone transfer which will list any aliases `host -l <target url> <name server>`
    - DNS inverse queries are similar to a ZT but queries an IP address for any associated symbolic-names, relying on a PTR (Pointer Record) - `dig -x <ip address>
    - There are websites such as [Netcraft search DNS](https://searchdns.netcraft.com/?host) service that will perform this lookup itself
    - Reverse-IP services are like inverse queries but query a web-app instead of a name server. It is good to use multiple to collate results: [Domain Tools Reverse IP](https://www.domaintools.com/reverse-ip/), [Bing](https://bing.com/) syntax: `ip:x.x.x.x`, [Webhosting info](http://whois.webhosting.info/) syntax: `http://whois.webhosting.info/x.x.x.x`

---

### Review Webpage Content for Information Leakage
It is important to review the webpage content and source files to better understand the application and potentially gain valuable information for profiling the target (could also be useful for social engineering).

**Test Objectives:**
- Review HTML source for `META`data and comments leaking information
- Review JS files to understand application client logic
- Review source map files

Source map files will usually be loaded when the DevTools are open. Testers can find the source map files by adding `.map` to the extension of a JS file.
For example: `/static/js/main.chunk.js` becomes `/static/js/main.chunk.js.map` which reveals:
```
{
  "version": 3,
  "file": "static/js/main.chunk.js",
  "sources": [
    "/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/index.js",
    "/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/reportAction.js",
    "/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/cashoutAction.js",
    "/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/userAction.js",
    "..."
  ],
  "..."
}
```

---

### Identify Application Entry Points
Understanding how the application uses HTTP requests & responses can show valuable entry points that can be tested later. Particular attention should be paid to `GET` & `POST` operations.

**Test Objectives:** Identify possible entry and injection points through request and response analysis

**Requests:**
- Identify where GETs and POSTs are used
- Identify all parameters in POST requests
- Identify hidden parameters in POST requests
- Identify all query params in GET requests
- Understand the purpose of each param found (and whether is encoded / encrypted) as it may or may not be required later
- Identify any abnormal additional or custom type headers (eg. `debug: false`)

**Responses:**
- Identify is cookies are set, modified, or added to (`Set-Cookie` header)
- Identify any redirects (3xx HTTP codes), 4xx codes (particularly 403 Forbidden), and 5xx server errors during normal responses (eg. unmodified requests).
- Note any interesting headers eg. `Server: BIG-IP` means that the server is load balanced so test to see if one server is incorrectly configured

**OWASP Attack Surface Detector**
A tool (plugin for ZAP & Burp) that can be used to automatically identify endpoints in an application's source code, being exported as JSON. This could be given by a customer who doesn't want to provide the source itself too. [CLI Available Here](https://github.com/secdec/attack-surface-detector-cli/releases), [Burp ASD Plugin](https://github.com/secdec/attack-surface-detector-burp/wiki).

---

### Map Execution Paths Through the Application
Building out a large map / spreadsheet to map out the application and its execution paths can help a tester understand the workflows and potential areas to explore.

**Test Objective:** Map the target application's execution paths and understand its principal workflows

**Types of Approaches:**
- **Path** : Follow each path, inputting random, boundary, invalid data for testing each decision path. Thoroughness but grows exponentially.
- **Data Flow** : Tests how data (inputted by a user) flows through the application (transformation and usage). Understand what goes in, how its manipulated, used, and stored.
- **Race** : Test multiple concurrent instances of the application manipulating the same data.

**Spidering:** You can use something like the spider tool in the [Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) to analyse and discover new URLs on a target.

---

### Fingerprint Web Application Framework
Similar to understanding the web server being used, it is also possible to use similar pointers to identify which web application framework is being used.

**Test Objective:** Fingerprint the components being used by the web application

**Common Pointer Locations:**
- HTTP Headers
- Cookies
- HTML Source Code
- Specific files and folders
- File extensions
- Error messages

**HTTP Headers**
The `X-Powered-By` header can be a dead giveaway on any HTTP response. Carefully checking the headers and understanding what each of them mean is a key identifier for an application's framework.

**Cookies**
Many frameworks have their own specific cookies and these can narrow down the attack surface.

**HTML Source Code**
Explore the source code for giveaways of the framework: comments, framework specific paths, and script variables can all be used as fingerprints of a framework.

**Specific files and folders**
Using forced browsing and something like burp intruder, it is possible to determine the existence of specific files and folders as each framework has its own directory structure. There is a value in setting up a temporary installation of the frameworks and web apps being tested to gain a better understanding of what infrastructure or functionality. The [FuzzDB wordlists of predictable files/folders](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb) is a good list for this exact test.

Always check the `Robots.txt` file first as this may give away information on this.

**File Extensions**
Understanding file extensions can give away key identifiers eg. `.php`.

**Error Messages**
Error messages can also give away frameworks through file names or default messages.

**Remediation**
"Security through obscurity" - only to slow down basic attackers, efforts may be better on educating awareness.

**Useful Tools**
- [WhatWeb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb) - Default in Kali
- [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/) - Website and browser extension (has false positives and not as thorough but give likely indication)

---

### Map Application Architecture
It is important to map the network and application architecture to be able to perform an in-depth review.

**Test Objective:** Generate a map of the application through research conducted

Start with a "simple application" approach and look for:
- Reverse Proxies
  - Analysing the web server banner in the response
  - Analysing the response behaviour against known web app attacks
    - If a 404 is normally received when going to an unavailable page, but when a web attack is deployed it returns an error then we can suggest there is an application-level firewall or reverse proxy acting as an IPS.
  - If an app returns a set of available HTTP methods but some expected methods result in an error, something may be blocking them
- Firewalls 
  - no answer or ICMP unreachables received
  - an TCP Reset (RST) packet will be returned from non-listening ports if the server is internet connected
- Proxy caches
  - Time the requests and compare against the first request to subsequent ones
- Different servers
  - Examine multiple requests and determine if there are any discrepancies
    - Dates may not be synced
    - Headers may be different
    - Cookies may be different or contain prefixes
- Application web servers
  - Their responses will vary significantly (including different or additional headers)
  - It may set cookies
- Back-end Systems
  - LDAP directories, relational databases, or RADIUS servers
  - Difficult to identify externally
  - Existence can often be given away through the application eg. dynamic content
  - Detailed knowledge of the underlying database is normally only available through a vulnerable surface (eg. poor exception handling, SQLi)

Continue asking questions to build up the map, "what type?", "How is it configured?", "Could it be bypassed?"

## [2. Configuration and Deployment Management Testing](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/README)
### Test Network Infrastructure Configuration
The following steps need to be taken to test the configuration management infrastructure:
- Determine different elements that make up the infrastructure and understand how they interact & affect security
- Review all elements for known vulnerabilities
- Review administrative tools used to manage infrastructure
- Review authentication systems
- List the defined ports an application requires and keep under change control

**Test Objectives:**
- Review applications' configurations across the network
- Validate frameworks & systems are secure and not susceptible to known vulnerabilities due to unmaintained software or default settings / credentials

**Known Server Vulnerabilities**
It can be difficult to test for known vulnerabilities as it requires knowing the server versions which aren't always accessible. Additionally, some vendors do not update version numbers when deploying security patches for known vulnerabilities so many automated tools can be tripped up by these (providing false positives), in addition if the server versions are available then a tool could report a false negative.

Sometimes vulnerabilities aren't disclosed publicly either so tools may not be aware of the issues or lesser known products. A review is best done with internal information on the software used, including versions, releases used & patches applied.

All vulnerabilities identified should be verified before reported.

**Administrative Tools**
Determine how each component of the system's architecture is managed (admin consoles, FTP servers etc):
- Understand how access is controlled and their associated susceptibilities. Info may only be online.
- Ensure default credentials aren't being used.

### Test Application Platform Configuration
**Test Objectives:**
- Ensure defaults and known files have been removed
- Validate no debugging code of extensions are left in prod
- Review logging mechanisms in the application

**Samples and Known Files and Directories**
Ensure that no known vulnerabilities exist for the framework or technology being used that are in the default installation files (search online). Then check if the associated files are present and ensure that only files needed by the application are present. Use a CGI Scanner (Web vulnerability scanner) to quickly check for known files or directory samples. Only a manual review of the full contents of a web/app server can determine if they are related to the application or not.

**Comment Review**
Check the HTML for comments left behind that could leak information. Save copies of all the pages and search for comments.

**System Configuration**
Some tools can be used to aid in this process of checking system configurations:
- [CIS-CAT Lite](https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/introducing-cis-cat-lite/)
- [Microsoftâ€™s Attack Surface Analyzer](https://github.com/microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer)
- [NISTâ€™s National Checklist Program](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository)

**Configuration Review**
It's hard to say what the config should be used generically but we are looking for common mistakes and insecurities for the specific application:
- Only enabling modules in use if possible (reduce attack surface)
- Custom error pages that doesn't leak information
- Minimal privileges
- Logs both legit access and failed attempts
- Properly handles overloads and prevent DoS - properly performance-tuned
- Non-admin users don't have access to admin config files (eg. `applicationHost.config`, `redirection.config`, `administration.config`)
- Make sure admin config isn't shared on the network
- No sensitive information in non-admin only files

**Logging**
Test and analyse the log contents for:
- Sensitive information
- Where are they stored?
  - Storing logs on a dedicated server can help with performance for log analysis but also makes it more difficult for attackers to wipe logs using *Log Zapper* tools.
- Could logs create a DoS?
  - If stored on the same partition as the application writes too, an attacker could fill up the storage with logs and cause to application to fail to write and error, possibly causing a DoS
  - Sending a sufficient and sustained number of requests can identify if they are all logged.
  - Sometimes the QUERY_STRING params are logged in full and can be used to fill up the logs faster.
- How are they rotated? Are they stored for long enough?
  - Logs are kept for exactly the time in the security policy, no more no less
  - Once rotated, logs are compressed
  - File systems are the same (or stricter) for rotated logs
  - Ensure an attacker cannot trigger a log rotation (eg. automatic rotate once a certain file size is reached)
- How are they reviewed? Can they be used to detect targeted attacks?
  - Make sure the access control is effective and correct
  - Ensure that logs are being reviewed to analyse potential web server attacks (40x errors & 50x errors) could indicate vuln scanners or unintended functionality being attacked
  - Log analysis shouldn't be stored on the same server that produces the logs as they reveal similar information as the logs themselves
- Are backups preserved?
- Is the data being validated prior to being logged?
  - Min/max length, chars etc

### Test File Extensions Handling for Sensitive Information
**Test Objectives:**
- Dirbust sensitive file extensions or extensions that contain raw data
- Validate that no system framework bypasses exist on the rules set

**Forced Browsing**
Use forced browsing to possibly retrieve varying files by specifying the extensions eg. `.config`, `connection.inc`.

Also look for things like `.pdf`, `.bak`, `.txt` etc.

Scanners, spiders, manual inspection, and search engine queries can all be useful in this testing.

### Review old Backup and Unreferenced Files for Sensitive Information
It is easy to forget old backups or unreferenced files and sometimes these contain security threats. These threats could be source code visibility, credentials, or other information exposure. Backups could contain old vulnerable code that has been later patched but could still be exploited if the older files are revealed.

**Test Objective:**
- Find and analyse unreferenced files for information exposure

**Infer naming conventions**
Enumerating through the application could reveal naming conventions that could be crafted to locate unreferenced pages. eg. `/app/user` infers there may be `/app/admin` or `/app/manager`.

**Other Clues**
- Check source files for references that are only used under certain conditions
- Comments in code
- Robots.txt
- Some directories might be misconfigured and show a directory listing
- Publicly available information

**Blind Guessing**
Automated scripts can be used to guess directories and file names using HTTP requests. `HEAD` can be used instead of `GET` in some applications for faster results. Look out for interesting status codes as it could indicate further investigation is required.

Blind guessing should be run against each directory identified (advanced techniques are to use specific file extensions for known areas of the application eg. html, jsp, jsx). For each file identified, create a word list from that filename with common extensions (including `~`, `bak`, `old`, `copy` etc).

**Remediation**
- Do no edit files directly on the server, its likely to generate backups or temporary files by the editors.
- Be careful not to leave files behind if performing administration activities on the file system exposed by the webserver
- Config management policies should help prevent obsolete and un-referenced files
- Web apps should be designed not to create, or rely on files in the web directory trees served by the app. Store these files in directories that cannot be accessed by the web server itself
- Prevent file system snapshots from being accessible via the web

**Tools**
- Vulnerability Assessment
  - [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)
  - [Nikto2](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)
- Web Spider tools
  - [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
  - [Wget for windows](http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/wgetwin.html)
  - [Sam spade](https://web.archive.org/web/20090926061558/http://preview.samspade.org/ssw/download.html)
  - [Spike proxy includes a crawler](https://www.spikeproxy.com/)
  - [xenu](http://home.snafu.de/tilman/xenulink.html)
  - [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

### Enumerate Infrastructure and Application Admin Interfaces
**Test Objective:** Identify any hidden admin interfaces and functions

- Directory and file enumeration
- Forced browsing
- Comments and links in source code
- Reviewing server and app documentation
- Publicly available information
- Alternative server port
- Parameter tampering

**Tools**
- [OWASP ZAP - Forced Browse](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/forced-browse/) is a currently maintained use of OWASPâ€™s previous DirBuster project.
- [THC-HYDRA](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) is a tool that allows brute-forcing of many interfaces, including form-based HTTP authentication.
- A brute forcer is much better when it uses a good dictionary, for example the [netsparker](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/svn-digger-better-lists-for-forced-browsing/) dictionary.

**Useful References**
- [Cirt: Default Password list](https://cirt.net/passwords)
- [FuzzDB can be used to do brute force browsing admin login path](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/blob/master/discovery/predictable-filepaths/login-file-locations/Logins.txt)
- [Common admin or debugging parameters](https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/blob/master/attack/business-logic/CommonDebugParamNames.txt)

### Test HTTP Methods
[Valid HTTP Methods](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3):
- `GET` : Retrieve an object
- `HEAD` : Get without a body (lightweight)
- `POST` : Send data to a server
- `PUT` : Replace/Create an object on the server
- `DELETE` : Delete an object
- `CONNECT` : Establish a connection to a server
- `OPTIONS` : Determine the communication options available
- `TRACE` : Request the server to send the trace request back

**Test Objectives:**
- Enumerate supported HTTP methods
- Test for access control bypass
- Test XST vulnerabilities
- Test HTTP method overriding techniques

**Supported Methods**
The `OPTIONS` method is a direct way to determine the supported methods but make sure to verify the response using requests with different methods. The nmap `http-methods` script can verify these automatically:
```
nmap -p <port> --script http-methods --script-args http-methods.url-path="<path>" <host>
```
*Test that all endpoints only accept the methods they require.*

**Bypassing Access Control**
If a page that has access control eg. redirects you to a login or denies access on a GET, it may be possible to get alternative behaviour using other methods or made up ones.

**Cross-site Tracing Attacks (XST)**
The `TRACE` method instructs the server to reflect the received message back to the client. Because of this fact, an XSS could send a TRACE request on a user's browser and receive back the cookie (bypassing the `HttpOnly` flag that prevents JS from accessing the cookie).

`TRACE` calls are disabled for JS in browsers now but other methods have been found to perform this.

**HTTP Method Overriding**
Some web frameworks allow the actual HTTP method to be overridden in the request. The main purpose of this is to circumvent some middleware (eg. proxy, framework etc) that wouldn't allow the certain method. This can be done by adding a custom headers:
- `X-HTTP-Method`
- `X-HTTP-Method-Override`
- `X-Method-Override`

### Test HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
The HSTS feature forces a browser to connect using only HTTPS. The header contains two directives:
- `max-ages`: the number of seconds that the browser should automatically convert all HTTP requests to HTTPS
- `includeSubDomains`: indicate that all related sub-domains should use HTTPS

`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

Test the header to find out if:
- An attacker could sniff the network traffic and access information through an un-encrypted channel
- An attacker can perform an manipulator in the middle attack because of accepting certificates that aren't trusted
- Users can mistakenly enter HTTP instead of HTTPS and use the insecure HTTP protocol

**How to Test**
Check if the header is present on the website via a proxy or:
```
curl -s -D- <address> | grep -i strict
```

### Test Cross Domain Policy
Check that CORS and any cross-domain headers are using the least privilege practice
