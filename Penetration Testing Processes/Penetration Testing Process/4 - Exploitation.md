During this stage we are looking for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired intention (eg. a foothold, escalated privileges etc).

## Prioritisation of Possible Attacks
Once we have found a vulnerability or two during the [[3 - Vulnerability Assessment]] stage, that applies to our target, we can prioritise those attacks. Within these attacks, we can prioritise based on:
- Probability of success : we can use theÂ [NVD calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) to help with this one
- Complexity : time, research, and effort to perform the attack (eg. very complex if we haven't done it before)
- Probability of Damage : make sure we don't cause damage for real

## Preparing an Attack
You should try to build a replica system that you can test on and better understand what your exploit will do / effect. If an attack is too risky, you you speak to the client as we do not want to cause real damage.
