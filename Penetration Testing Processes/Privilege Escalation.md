```table-of-contents

This process aims to go from a low privilege user to a full privilege user (`root / administrator / SYSTEM`).

## Checklists
Its useful to have checklists to follow through for this process. [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) & [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) are both great resources for these checklists.

## Enumeration Scripts
Many privilege exploits can be automated and scripts can enumerate through possibilities. These can be very noisy so sometimes manual investigation is better for more evasive intentions.
