## Document and Audit
Regular auditing and documentation of an AD environment is absolutely critical to an organisation's security posture. We should look to document and track:
- Naming conventions of OUs, computers, users, and group
- DNS, network, and DHCP configuration
- An intimate understanding of all GPOs and the objects that they are applied to
- Assignment of FSMO roles (*Flexible Single Master Operation - ensures*)
