## Summary

Network Mapper (Nmap) is a tool for performing network scans and one of the most commonly used tools for network activities. Nmap supports an extensive scripting engine that can be used to extend the functionality of the tool and your scans.

Nmap by default conducts TCP scans but can be requested to use UDP. 
> If a `STATE` appears as `filtered` that means there is a firewall only allowing connections from certain addresses.

[Zenmap](https://nmap.org/zenmap/) is a GUI utility for nmap.
