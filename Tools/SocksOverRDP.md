## Summary
[SocksOverRDP](https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP) is a tool that uses *Dynamic Virtual Channels* (*DVC*) from Windows' Remote Desktop Service. DVC can tunnel packets over an RDP connection, this is how clipboard sharing and audio sharing works in RDP. This feature can also be used for arbitrary network packets, allowing us to tunnel custom packets through and use the system as a proxy (a tool like [[Proxifier]] can be used as the proxy server).
