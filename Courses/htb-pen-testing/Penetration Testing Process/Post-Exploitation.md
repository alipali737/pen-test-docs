The aim of this stage is to *obtain sensitive or security-relevant information* from a local perspective, and business-relevant information that requires higher privileges than standard.

## Evasive Testing
- Don't set off security alarms
- Worst case, we get kicked off the network and threat hunting against us begins
- We could lose access to a host or account.
- The pen test would fail but the success is the client detected our actions, still providing value by writing it all up and showing any gaps.
- Types of testing:
	- *Evasive* : trying to hide completely and find their blind-spots
	- *Hybrid-Evasive* : progressively get 'noisier' until we are detected to find what things can withstand
	- *Non-Evasive* : most in-depth test but requires us to not be bound by security measures
