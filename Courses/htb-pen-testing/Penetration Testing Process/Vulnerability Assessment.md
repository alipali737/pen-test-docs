> An analysis is a detailed explanation of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that will the help of certain precautions and actions, can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences.

 It is critical to either confirm or disprove our conclusions from our results & information. An example is: *we discover there is an open TCP port 2121 on a host during information gathering*.

We must distinguish between what we *see* and what we *have*
- A *TCP* port *2121* --> *TCP* means that the service is *connection-oriented*
- Is this a *standard* port? --> *No*, standard ports are between 0-1023, aka well-know or [system ports](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
- Are there any numbers in this *port* that look *familiar*? --> *Yes*, *TCP* port *21* is *FTP*. So we should test (via Netcat or an FTP client) to see if this is a *FTP port in disguise*, confirming or disproving our conclusion.
- If upon connecting we realise it takes a while to connect, we can begin to guess why our initial *scan failed* --> potentially it timed-out? Try rerunning the scan on that target with a longer minimum timeout probe (`nmap --min-rtt-timeout`).

During this phase we are **using our information gathered & vulnerability research** to **look for known vulnerabilities, exploits, and security holes** that have already been reported. We can try searching for any [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs) related to a service or application version. A few sources for this are:

| [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/)                 | [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)               | [Vulners](https://vulners.com/) |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| [Packet Storm Security](https://packetstormsecurity.com/) | [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search?execution=e2s1) |                                 |
Once we find a published vulnerability, we must understand what causes it and whether it could apply to our target.

## Assessment of Possible Attack Vectors
We want to be performing some actual testing here, we are looking at historical information as well as current information we have discovered. It is also a very important part for evasive attacks to attempt to mimic the target locally as closely as you can so you can test freely without detection before trying exploits on the target.

## The Return
If we are unable to identify any potential vulnerabilities from our analysis, we want to return to the [[Information Gathering]] stage and look in more detail. These two stages (*information gathering* and *vulnerability assessment*) often overlap and require us to move between them regularly.

The focus of a penetration test is quality and intensity, we are looking for ALL weaknesses, not just how fast we can compromise the target.
