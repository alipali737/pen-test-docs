> An analysis is a detailed explanation of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that will the help of certain precautions and actions, can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences.

 It is critical to either confirm or disprove our conclusions from our results & information. An example is: *we discover there is an open TCP port 2121 on a host during information gathering*.

We must distinguish between what we *see* and what we *have*
- A *TCP* port *2121* --> *TCP* means that the service is *connection-oriented*
- Is this a *standard* port? --> *No,*
