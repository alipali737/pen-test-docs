## Three Components
1. Scoping questionnaire : 
2. Pre-engagement meeting : 
3. Kick-off meeting : 

## Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
- *Unilateral NDA* : only applies confidentiality to one party, the other may share with third parties
- *Bilateral NDA* : both parties must keep the resulting and acquired information confidential (most common for PTs)
- *Multilateral NDA* : a confidentiality agreement between more than two parties

It is also **critical to consider who is contracting the penetration test**, as not everyone has the authorisation to contract a test. This could include senior IT management, C-Level staff, or Auditors.

## Scoping Questionnaire
- We would typically send this questionnaire to better understand what they want
- Typically explains and asks them to choose a service they would like
- This gives us an initial idea of what they want, what it will likely include etc allowing us to align expectations and adequately deliver on their needs
- This could include things like:
	- How many hosts?
	- How many domains in scope?
	- What are the objectives for Red Teaming?
	- Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?
- Finally we ask about information disclosure and evasiveness (if applicable)
- Based on all this information we will create the *Scoping Document*
